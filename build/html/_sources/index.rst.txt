Welcome to Ian's blog documentation!
=====================================

This is my blog! There are many like it, but this one is mine. Here I'll mostly
be documenting my attempt at creating a blog from mostly scratch. To most
people, that might sound like a very odd thing seeing as there are plenty of
platforms out there that make blogging fun and easy for you, but I'm not using
them because this blog isn't about that. In this blog, I'll be using Sphinx, a
documentation platform for the Python language to create the HTML pages, which
I'll then be hosting on either Github or Gitlab so that I can get some
experience with Python, documentation, and version control systems all at once.

Am I a total newbie at this stuff? Absolutely. Do I have a challenge with taking
notes? Most definitely. But these are reasons *for* this endeavor.
