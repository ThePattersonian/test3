==================
 Working with Git
==================

As this is my first project working with git, github and/or gitlab, it's also
my first project working with any sort of version control system. On this page,
I'll be writing about the steps used with git to make things work.

The first thing to do with git is to turn a directory (a folder) into a
repository using the Command Line Interface (CLI) command::

  git init

Then I need to add some content to the folder. To update the repository, I need
to use some version of ``git add``. Files can be added one by one, or they can
be added all at once or just the updated ones using the following commands::

  git add <filename>
  git add .
  git add -A
  git add -u

  There
