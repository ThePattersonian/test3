==================
 Github vs Gitlab
==================

Here I'll be documenting my experience with using Github and Gitlab, comparing
the two and seeing which one works better for the purposes of making this blog.


Github
=======

One of the major benefits of using Github is that there are millions of
repositories that use it and it has become one of the standards for Version
Control Systems (VCS). As such, learning to navigate it and work within its
ecosystem will be highly beneficial for me. That being said, I find that
Github's own documentation is lacking and quite often I'll need to look up how
to do something over on StackOverflow.

One major problem, at least for me and my attempt at creating something akin to
a blog with Github, is that in order to host a page for a project on Github, the
project must be public. Additionally, Github limits the number of projects one
can have for free.

Gitlab
========

Gitlab is a smaller VCS ecosystem than Github currently, but it seems to be
picking up marketshare. This is probably due to its focus on creating whole
pipelines (whatever that jargon word is supposed to describe) and its focus on
continuous delivery (CI/CD). Additionally, Gitlab has more documentation built
in to its own ecosystem, such that in order to get a page up and running on
Gitlab.io, I was able to find most of the relevant steps on Gitlab hosted pages.
Gitlab also makes it easy to import projects from other VCSs and allows people
to create pages for private projects.

In short, I think Gitlab offers many extra features and is easier to use than
Github. However, I think I will still be using Github for this project as its
more of a learning experience.
